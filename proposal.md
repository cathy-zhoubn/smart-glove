## Project Title
Smart Glove for Sign Langauge Recognition

## Project description
We will build a smart glove that detects the user’s hand gestures. As the client uses American Sign Language, our glove will recognize the 26 letters they gesture.

The glove has five flex sensors on the five fingers to detect the extent of bending of the fingers. Each of the flex sensors is connected to an Analog-to-Digital Converter to read the resistance values. The glove also has an accelerometer that measures the rotation of the hand. These six degrees of freedom will be sufficient to distinguish the sign language gestures.

If time permits, we would like to integrate this glove into a console. As clients use American Sign Language, the glove will transcribe the symbols onto the console. We would also like to give teaching feedback to the clients: if the client is a first-time learner of American Sign Language, our product will allow the client to go through each of A - Z and provide suggestions, such as “bend your thumb!”

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
By next Week 10 Wed Lab, we hope to be able to read input from the accelerometer and the flex sensor modulo that we can work with.

## Resources needed, issues
We may need help with the various sensors that we use. We would love it if we could get some help when stuck.

In addition, we wonder if we could get some additional budget (if some other groups are not using all of their budgets). We would really appreciate it!
